# Activated Sigil Fix
Fix for activated abilities in the game Inscryption

Thanks a bunch to Ara for the thunderstore icon <3

This mod allows you to use the activated sigils from act 2 (and any custom activated sigil mods) in act 1 & 3 (untested in act 3) by clicking the icon of the card.

**Note:** This doesn't add the art for existing sigils, for that, install [SigilArtFix](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/MADH95Mods/SigilArtPatch/)
